============
Transformers
============
This is my replication from scratch of the article Attentino is all you need: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
    
Use-case example is German-to-English machine translation.

Architecture
------------
This project replicates the original architecture of Transformers which is basically Encoder-Deconder model with a lot of attentions.

Data
----

The model is trained on 30k English-German translation dataset: https://pytorch.org/text/stable/datasets.html#multi30k 

=====
Reproduce the results
=====

1. Get model weights
-----
The pre-trained weights are stored on my Drive. You can use the link below to add the shortcut (no need to download)

- Add shortcut to Google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fQLCFoj2-RmS1M-LzyaSlUYVOS8LSrE1/view?usp=sharing


2. Load IPython
-----
Prepare a colab session

- Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 
- select 'GitHub' and past https://github.com/nikitakapitan/transformers
- choose [DEMO]Predict.ipynb

3. Run the notebook
----
Simply execute the cells. It will:

- install and import required packages
- mount your Google Drive and copy **model weights** to colab session
 - at this point you should have **multi30k_model_final.pt** file in your Google Drive from step 1.
- **check_outputs** function prints the results from the table above.

Note: you won't see the exact same sentences due to random batch. But the quality of translation will remain the same.
